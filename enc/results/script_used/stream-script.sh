export OMP_SCHEDULE=static  # Disable dynamic loop scheduling
export OMP_PROC_BIND=TRUE   # Bind threads to specific resources
export OMP_DYNAMIC=false    # Disable dynamic thread pool sizing

# OMP_PLACES is used for binding OpenMP threads to cores
# See: https://www.openmp.org/spec-html/5.0/openmpse53.html
# For example, a dual socket AMD 4th Gen EPYCâ„¢ Processor with 192 (96x2) cores,
# with 4 threads per L3 cache: 96 total places, stride by 2 cores:
export OMP_PLACES={0:64:1}
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=64
